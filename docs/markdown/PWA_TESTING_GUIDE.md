# PWA Installation Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Step 1: Generate Required Icons
1. Open `create-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click "Generate Icons" 
3. Download both `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
4. Place both files in the `images/` folder

### Step 2: Start Local Server
Run `start-pwa-server.bat` to start a local development server.

### Step 3: Test Installation

#### **Desktop Testing (Chrome/Edge)**
1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Look for install icon in address bar: ⊕ or ⬇️
3. Click install button when it appears
4. App should install and open in standalone window

#### **Mobile Testing (Android Chrome)**
1. Open Chrome on Android device
2. Navigate to your server IP: `http://[YOUR-IP]:8000`
3. Tap menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen"
4. App icon should appear on home screen

#### **Mobile Testing (iOS Safari)**
1. Open Safari on iOS device  
2. Navigate to your server IP: `http://[YOUR-IP]:8000`
3. Tap share button (□↗) → "Add to Home Screen"
4. App icon should appear on home screen

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Install button doesn't appear
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Ensure PNG icons are in `images/` folder
- ✅ Check browser console for manifest errors
- ✅ Verify service worker registration
- ✅ Use HTTPS or localhost (PWAs require secure context)

### Problem: Icons not displaying correctly
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Generate icons using `create-icons.html`
- ✅ Verify file names: `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
- ✅ Check file sizes (192x192 and 512x512 pixels)
- ✅ Clear browser cache and reload

### Problem: App doesn't work offline
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Check service worker in DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- ✅ Verify cache contents in DevTools → Application → Storage
- ✅ Force service worker update by incrementing version in `sw.js`

### Problem: Mobile install banner not showing
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Test on real device, not DevTools simulation
- ✅ Ensure user has interacted with page (tap/scroll)
- ✅ Check manifest.json has proper mobile configuration
- ✅ Verify display mode is set to "standalone"

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### **Android Chrome**
- ✅ Supports automatic install prompts
- ✅ Requires user interaction before showing prompt
- ✅ Install banner appears at bottom of screen
- ✅ App opens in full-screen standalone mode

### **iOS Safari**
- ❌ No automatic install prompts
- ✅ Manual installation via share menu
- ✅ Supports home screen icons
- ✅ Limited standalone mode support

### **Desktop Chrome/Edge**
- ✅ Install icon appears in address bar
- ✅ Supports window management APIs
- ✅ Full PWA feature support
- ✅ Behaves like native desktop app

## 🛠️ Developer Tools

### Chrome DevTools
1. **Application Tab**: Check manifest, service worker, storage
2. **Lighthouse Tab**: Run PWA audit for optimization tips
3. **Network Tab**: Test offline functionality
4. **Device Simulation**: Test mobile responsive design

### Useful Console Commands
```javascript
// Check if app is installed
navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()

// Check service worker status
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()

// Check manifest
console.log(document.querySelector('link[rel="manifest"]'))
